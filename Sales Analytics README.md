📊 Sales Analytics Dashboard – Power BI

  A comprehensive Sales Analytics Dashboard built in Power BI to analyze sales performance across multiple dimensions such as time, geography, customers, and product costs. This project demonstrates skills in data modeling, DAX measure creation, interactive reporting, and dashboard design.

🔍 Project Overview
  The Sales Analytics Dashboard provides a unified view of key business metrics, enabling stakeholders to track sales trends, customer distribution, and geographical performance. It highlights KPIs, monthly performance, regional insights, and customer-level sales contribution.

This project is part of my Business Intelligence portfolio, showcasing my ability to transform raw datasets into clear, actionable insights through interactive visualizations.

🧾 Key Features
1. KPI Summary Cards

At the top of the dashboard, key performance indicators give an at-a-glance understanding of business health:
$25.8M – Total Sales Amount
77K – Total Order Quantity
$597 – Average Sales
10.4K – Total Customers
2. Time-Based Analysis

A monthly breakdown of:
Sales Amount (bar chart)
Total Product Cost (line chart)
This visual helps identify peaks, dips, and changes in cost and revenue over time.

3. Geographic Insights
The dashboard includes two major geographical views:
Country-Level Sales (Donut Chart)
Shows contribution of each country (e.g., United States, Australia, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Canada) with percentage share.
State/Province Sales (Bar Chart)
Highlights top-performing regions such as:
California – $1.87M
England – $1.10M
New South Wales – $1.06M

This helps determine high-revenue areas for market strategy planning.

5. Customer Sales Breakdown
A searchable table listing:
State/Province

This enables deeper drill-down analysis of high-value customers and their locations.
